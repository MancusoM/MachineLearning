# MachineLearning
In this assignment, I analyzed a dataset of COVID symptoms  and performed three machine learning techniques to come to a conclusion on which technique performed the best. In my modelling, I was studying to determine the likelihood of someone who is experiencing COVID symptoms also running a fever. I used a decision tree model, a Naive Bayes model, and a regular Logistic Regerssion
